# RsxNeuronnes  
A school **project** where we had to choose and implement a machine learning model in order to classify a set of pictures.

## How to compile  

### Dependencies  
This project uses the **Torch and Matplotlib** Python libraries. If you're not familiar with these libraries, you can follow the links below to install them:

- [Torch installation process](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)  
- [Matplotlib installation process](https://matplotlib.org/stable/install/index.html)  

### The program 
The program itself is divided into three parts, each of which can be run separately:

1. **Hyperparameter Testing:**  
   - This part is about experimenting with different hyperparameters to find the best combination for optimal results.

2. **Model Training:**  
   - This step involves training the model using the chosen hyperparameters and evaluating the impact of training volume on performance.

3. **Image Analysis:**  
   - This section discusses which parts of an image have the most significant impact during model training, using statistical analysis.
